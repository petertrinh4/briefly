    You are an automotive parts researcher assisting repair shops, claims adjusters, or consumers who need replacement vehicle parts in Florida.

    Goal
    - No need to specify the make/model/year of the vehicle unless relevant to part identification.
    - Analyze vehicle damage (based on user description and/or photos) and identify the specific replacement parts likely required.
    - Produce a concise list of Florida-based suppliers that can supply those parts, with contact details and useful ordering information.
    - If vehicle details are missing, prompt the user for the minimum necessary information.

    Input requirements
    - If the user has not provided: ask for Year, Make, Model, Trim, Engine, VIN (optional), the damaged part(s) or attach photos, and location in Florida (city or ZIP).
    - If photos are provided, note any limitations of visual analysis and request additional details as needed.

    Output format (return as structured, human-readable bullets)
    1) Damage summary: 1–2 sentence analysis of the likely damaged components and why.
    2) Required parts list: short list of specific parts (part name, OEM part number if known, aftermarket equivalent suggestions).
    3) Florida suppliers (limit to up to 5 most relevant): for each supplier include:
       - Supplier name
       - Parts they sell / part numbers they stock (OEM or aftermarket)
       - Physical address (city, ZIP) and whether they have local pickup
       - Phone number and email (if available)
       - Website URL (direct link) and a 1–2 sentence note on relevance (e.g., stock, specialty, OEM dealer)
       - Estimated lead time or in-stock status (if determinable)
       - OEM vs aftermarket, and any notes on fitment or compatibility
    4) Price guidance: rough price range or ballpark estimate per part (label as estimate).
    5) Verification & next steps: specific actions to confirm fitment before ordering (VIN lookup, part number cross-check, ask for core/exchange policy, request photos of part tags), recommended search queries to find additional suppliers, and sample messages/scripts to use when calling/emailing suppliers.
    6) Confidence & assumptions: short statement of confidence level and any assumptions made (e.g., no VIN supplied, analysis based on photos only).

    Sourcing
    - Prefer primary supplier pages (dealer parts catalogs, major distributors, local recyclers) and include direct URLs for each authority or listing.
    - Verify suppliers are located in Florida (city/ZIP). If location cannot be confirmed, state that explicitly.

    Constraints & tone
    - Keep responses concise and actionable.
    - Do not perform transactions or give professional mechanical advice—deliver research and supplier options for the user or technician to evaluate.

    1) Case summary: 1–2 sentence restatement of the controlling facts and the legal issue.
    2) Litigation theories: list promising and novel legal theories; for each, give a 1–2 sentence explanation of why it fits the facts and the elements required.
    3) Supporting authority: for each theory, provide primary authorities (cases, statutes, regulations) including citation, jurisdiction, date, a direct URL, and a 1–2 sentence explanation of relevance and precedential weight.
    4) Strength assessment: assign a short strength rating (High/Medium/Low) with the key reasons and risks.
    5) Next steps & search queries: recommend targeted search queries, documents to obtain, and follow-up research priorities.

    Prefer primary, authoritative sources and note assumptions or uncertainty. Flag jurisdictional limits and any conflicting authority. Do not provide legal advice—deliver research, sources, options, and suggested lines of inquiry the lawyer can evaluate.

    Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or “No-Fault” Car Insurance 
 
    • Florida PIP 
    • In Florida, PIP pays for injuries sustained in an accident regardless of who was at-fault for the accident. 
    • In Florida, it is required to carry exactly $10,000 in PIP.   
    • PIP pays 80% of medical expenses (based on the Medicare fee schedule) and 60% of wage loss up to the policy limits of $10,000.  
    • PIP will also reimburse the following:  
    • Mileage to and from the doctor  
    • Replacement services expenses (i.e.: home cleaning, lawn care)  
    • Death benefits  
    • Workers Compensation lien reimbursement   
    • PIP Sources  
    • The primary source of PIP is the client’s personal auto policy. Even if the client was in a vehicle other than their own at the time of the accident, they would qualify for PIP under their personal policy. Their policy “follows them” into other vehicles.  
    • PIP Sources in order of priority  
    • Client’s personal policy  
    • Household relative’s policy  
    • Host vehicle (vehicle client was occupying if other than their own)  
    • Injured pedestrians and bicyclists can obtain PIP benefits through the at fault parties' carrier should the first two sources above are not available. 
    • There is no PIP on motorcycles or on public transportation (bus) 
    • Qualification  
    • To be qualified for PIP benefits in Florida, the client needs to seek treatment within fourteen (14) days from the crash date. A visit to a chiropractor, MD or Hospital will satisfy this requirement. If the client does not treat within fourteen (14) days, they will be denied PIP benefits. It is the Case Managers responsibility to make sure the client treats within fourteen (14) days.  
    • Emergency Medical Condition (EMC): An EMC is an opinion from a medical doctor. Without a diagnosed EMC, PIP is capped at $2,500. Most of the doctors we work with will automatically schedule the client to have an EMC appointment. An indicator that you clients PIP has had an “EMC cutoff” is that the PIP payout log is exactly $2,500. This is resolved with a call to the treating doctor to see if the client has had an EMC appointment. If so, the case manager can obtain the report from the chiro and forward to the PIP adjuster. Once received, the cutoff will be lifted and bills in line will be paid.   
    • Independent Medical Exam – Plaintiff's insurance company will refer client to an Independent Medical Exam (IME) to a physician hired by the insurance company to determine whether continued medical treatment is necessary. If client does not attend the Independent Medical Exam (IME), the client’s PIP benefits could be denied. 
    • PIP Cutoff - The physician has determined that continued treatment is not necessary and will give an end date of treatment.  
    • Upon receipt of a PIP cutoff letter refer the letter to our First Party Department for potential PIP suit. Some medical providers have their own attorney to file PIP suits.  
    • Helpful Tips  
    • PIP log: Request a log of PIP payments monthly to monitor that PIP is being paid out properly.  
 
    • Kentucky PIP (mandatory)  
   
    • Mississippi PIP (elective)    
 
Bodily Injury Liability Coverage (BI)    
 
    • We look for Bodily Injury Liability Coverage on the at-fault party's auto insurance. It is carried on policies to protect the policy holder should their vehicle injure someone else. On behalf of the injured party (our client), the attorney and Case Manager will pursue the at fault party’s BI coverage. It is the primary source of coverage we pursue to recover compensation for our client’s injuries.   
 
    • Each state has laws which set the mandatory minimum BI coverage individuals with registered vehicles must purchase.  
    • Florida:  Vehicle owners are not required to carry BI coverage in Florida. If they do elect to carry BI, the minimum amount they can purchase is $10,000/$20,000.  
    • GA, AL, KY and TN: Mandatory minimum BI is $25,000/$50,000. 
 
    • BI Sources  
    • The owner of the at fault vehicle’s policy is the primary source of BI coverage. If the driver is different from the owner and has their own policy, we can pursue their BI coverage as a second source. The driver’s BI coverage “follows them” into other vehicles should they cause an accident in someone else's vehicle.   
    • If there is comparative negligence between multiple vehicles, then we would purse each negligent vehicle BI policy.  
 
Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UM/UIM)    
 
    • Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage pays for bodily injury to you, family members, and certain others resulting from the negligence of others when the at-fault party does not carry enough coverage to pay for the bodily injuries incurred.   
 
    • UIM coverage can be used once you have exhausted the BI limits from the defendant's carrier.  
 
    • Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage take the place of an at-fault party who does not carry BI coverage or if the accident is the result of a hit and run vehicle.  
 
    • In many states, UM and UIM are used synonymously.  
 
    • UM/UIM Sources and Order of Priority    
    • Host vehicle’s policy 
    • Client’s personal policy 
    • Household relative’s policy 
 
    • UM Rejection/Selection Form: If UM/UIM is not a required coverage in your state and the policy holder does not wish to carry UM/UIM, the insurance carriers are required to have their insured document their decision by signing a UM Rejection Form. Our letter of representation asks the carrier to produce this signed form should the policy note the UM was rejected by the policy holder. If they cannot produce the signed or accurate rejection form the carrier must afford you UM coverage equal to the BI limits purchased. If the policy does not provide BI coverage, there is no need to obtain the rejection form.   
    • The UM selection/rejection form must be signed and dated with the appropriate box marked. If not, you could present a UM demand to the insurance company for the BI limits.  
 
    • UM coverage can only be purchased in an amount equal to or less than the amount of BI coverage which they have purchased.  
 
Florida UM    
 
    • Stacking UM: Depending on the state, policy holders may select the option to “stack” their UM coverage. Stacked coverage multiplies the coverage by the number of vehicles on the insured's policy.   
    • If the client carries $100/$300 stacking UM coverage and has three vehicles on their policy, their UM limits are actually $300/$900.  
 
    • UM Permission: In Florida, the UM carrier has the right to subrogate on the BI limits. When you settle BI for limits and there is UM available to pursue you must get permission from the UM carrier before you bank the BI settlement check.  
    • The UM carrier will perform an asset check on the defendant. If it is determined that the defendant has assets, the UM carrier may “front the money” which means they would pay the BI limits to go after the defendant/tortfeasor for not having enough bodily injury coverage to equate to their assets. For example, a millionaire with a BI policy of $10k. 

Medical Payments Coverage    
    • Med Pay is an elective coverage that can help pay the medical bills. 
    • If there is PIP and Med Pay available. PIP will pay 80% of the bills up to $10,000 and Med Pay will pay the remaining 20% up until the selected amount is exhausted.  
    • If there is Med Pay only it pays at 100% of the Medicare allowed amount 
    • Florida Med Pay: Carriers try to subrogate or collect reimbursement on the med pay benefits paid out, but our firm is fighting this practice.    
    • Letters must be sent out when there is medical payments coverage available. Check with current standard when sending out these letters. 
 
Property Damage Coverage & Collision Coverage  
 
    • Property damage coverage will pay for damage to another party's property should the policy holder be found at fault for a crash. It is common for our client to pursue the defendant's property damage coverage. In most states, carrying property damage coverage is mandatory.  
 
    • Collision coverage is an elected coverage that covers the policy holder's property regardless of fault.   
 
 
    • While we technically only represent our client for the injury portion of the claim it is essential that we help make sure their property damage claim resolves. Not having a working vehicle due to someone else's negligence is a major disruption to our client’s lives. It can impact their means of transportation to and from work and medical treatment.  
Collateral Sources & Subrogation 
 
Collateral sources refer to medical payments, most commonly health insurance, that may require repayment prior to the settlement of a legal claim. All except where otherwise noted can be put on notice using the Collateral Source letter. 
 
Collateral Sources 
 
    • Any entity that makes payments towards your client’s medical bills  
 
    • Many of these entities have language written into their plans/policies which give them a legal right to recover the money they paid towards the bills if the injury was caused by a 3rd party (i.e.: at-fault driver or negligent premises)  
 
 
    • They assert this legal right in the form of a lien 
 
Subrogation 
 
    • Subrogation is the process of seeking reimbursement for the payments made.  
 
    • As soon as you become aware of an entity that could potentially pay on the bills (i.e.: health insurance) send the Collateral Source letter to the entity 
 
  
    • You must obtain a response to your Collateral Source letter to confirm if the entity is or is not asserting a lien  
 
    • Whichever entity sends the response (could be a 3rd party agency) is who you will be corresponding with to obtain updated liens, final liens, reduction requests, and to dispute charges.   
 
Types of Health Insurance 
 
Private Health Insurance 
    • Purchased through insurance carrier or through the client’s private employer 
 
    • Notice 
    • Obtain copy of client’s health insurance card (front & back) 
    • Document Claim address (on back of card), Member ID and Group number 
    • Send Collateral Source Letter with HIPAA 
 
    • ERISA 
    • If an employer funds their health insurance plan entirely out of their own assets, the ERISA law allows them extremely strong reimbursement rights. This can weaken our leverage when asking for lien reductions. They can ask for 100% repayment and we have little recourse.   
    • Always ask for reductions despite a health insurance carrier claiming they are a 100% self-funded ERISA plan. 
Medicare 
    • Federal entitlement program - 65 years or older and some disabilities 
 
    • CMS Portal 
    • Can be used to put Medicare on notice, request updated liens (Conditional Payment Amounts), dispute charges, and notify of settlement/request final lien. 
 
    • Once they are notified of settlement, we have 60 days to make payment in full or interest will start accruing. If excessive interest accrues it could affect their Medicare benefits. DO NOT LET INTEREST ACCRUE. 
    • Alert lability carrier of potential issues for client if they report notice of settlement to Medicare 
    • Ask adjuster not to report the case as settled because “funds are not being disbursed at this time.” 
 
    • Medicare supplements – Need to be put on notice separately 
 
    • Medicare Set Aside – if settlement is $250k or more, Medicare may take the position that they will not be paying future claims 
    • Need to advise client of potential need for Medicare set aside if 250k and up settlement - Contact Monarch Structured Settlements  
 
    • Reductions: Will automatically reduce their lien once notified of settlement amount, attorney fee, and costs. 
 
Medicaid 
    • State run entitlement program – children / low income / disabilities 
 
    • Advise the client of possible income disqualification if the settlement causes their monitored bank account to reach a disqualifying amount  
    • Can lose benefits – Bad situation for someone with ongoing health issues 
    • Around – 2k in account/assets 
    • Advise client of potential need for a special needs trust – they are likely aware of threshold to lose Medicaid benefits 
Federal Employee Health Benefits / VA / Tri Care 
    • Tricare: Collateral Source letter should go to the Staff Advocate General 
 
    • VA: Does not normally generate billing so slow to produce 
 
    • Will reduce by fees and costs 
 
    • Slow: If slow turnaround, give the client number to the client’s representative and ask client to call them and complain 
 
Workers’ Compensation  
    • Clients that are injured within scope of employment may have a separate, but overlapping, Workers’ Compensation claim with their PI case. 
 
    • If they have a separate case, it will be handled by one of our Workers’ Comp attorneys, who will help guide them through their workers’ comp claim. 
 
    • How does Workers’ Comp affect my PI case? 
    • The workers’ comp carrier will arrange treatment with workers’ comp doctors. It is important that the client complete their treatment with the workers’ comp doctors. Do not pull the client from treatment if workers’ comp has not yet released them. 
    • Once the client is released from workers’ comp treatment, if they are still experiencing pain/symptoms, you may help facilitate additional treatment. It is common that the workers’ comp doctors release the client from treatment early. 
    • The collateral source letter must be sent to the workers’ comp carrier. The client can provide the contact information. 
    • The Workers’ Comp insurance carrier may assert a lien for the payments they have made towards the client’s treatment. 
    • The Workers’ Comp adjuster collects the workers’ comp related records and billing. If you ask for the records/billing they will send to you. 
 
    • Workers’ Compensation Lien: 
    • Florida 
    • Reductions are calculated by the Case Manager using the Manfredo Formula (see Education Folder) 
    • Pays 60% of wage – Can submit difference to PIP 
    • PIP Reimbursement: After reducing and paying the work comp lien you can submit proof of payment (copy of check) to Work Comp and PIP will reimburse should PIP benefits remain 
    • Georgia 
    • Made Whole Doctrine: GA Case Managers can argue that because the firm takes a fee from the client’s settlement, our client will never be “made whole” and thus are not required to pay back asserted liens. 
 
Short Term/Long Term Disability 
    • If client is out of work due to injury for an extended period of time, they may elect to utilize their short-term or long-term disability benefits. (if available) 
 
    • This coverage will pay them a portion of their wages while they are missing work 
 
    • They may have ST or LT disability benefits through a different carrier than you are already aware. 
 
Gov Disability Programs  
    • SSI - Supplemental Security Income   
    • Need based according to income and assets – for low-income clients who have never worked or cannot work due to disability  
 
    • SSID   - Social Security Disability Insurance  
    • Available to individuals who have worked and made contributions through payroll taxes, who now cannot work due to disability 
 
3rd Party Subrogation Agencies  
    • The insurance carrier may not be the agency that responds to you, as many use 3rd party agencies for subrogation. 
 
Steps of Correspondence:  
    • Send Collateral Source Letter with HIPAA Certified Mail & Faxed to collateral source entity  
 
    • Send To-Do/Task (CP/Litify) to follow up if no response from subrogation agency or carrier after 45 days  
 
    • Send Updated Lien Amount Letter or call for updated lien in writing periodically to monitor accruing lien charges 
 
    • Dispute unrelated payments after reviewing liens (if applicable)  
 
    • Request final lien amount when close to resolving case 
 
    • Request lien reduction
