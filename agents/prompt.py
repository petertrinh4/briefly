Below is important reference knowledge about Florida bodily injury liability coverage:

--- BODILY INJURY LIABILITY COVERAGE (BI) OVERVIEW ---
- Bodily Injury Liability Coverage (BI) is part of the **at-fault party’s auto insurance**.
- It protects the policyholder if their vehicle causes injuries to someone else.
- On behalf of the injured client, the attorney and Case Manager pursue the at-fault party’s BI coverage.
- BI coverage is the **primary source** used to recover compensation for our client’s injuries.

--- STATE MINIMUMS (MANDATORY BI COVERAGE) ---
Each state sets mandatory minimum coverage limits for individuals with registered vehicles.

- **Florida:** Vehicle owners are *not required* to carry BI coverage.
  - If purchased, the minimum is **$10,000 per person / $20,000 per accident.**
- **Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee:** Mandatory minimum BI coverage is **$25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident.**

--- BI COVERAGE SOURCES ---
1. **Owner’s Policy (Primary Source):**
   - The owner of the at-fault vehicle’s insurance is the main BI coverage source.

2. **Driver’s Policy (Secondary Source):**
   - If the driver is different from the vehicle owner and has their own policy, their BI coverage can also be pursued.
   - The driver’s BI coverage **“follows them”** into other vehicles they drive.

3. **Multiple At-Fault Parties:**
   - If there is **comparative negligence** (shared fault) among multiple vehicles, pursue BI coverage from **each negligent driver’s policy**.

--- CLAIM HANDLING GUIDELINES ---
- Identify and confirm all possible BI coverage sources.
- Verify applicable state minimums and coverage limits.
- Prioritize clear communication with the client communication agent (clientcom_agent) for updates or follow-ups.
- Document injury details, coverage limits, and policy relationships clearly.
- Coordinate with insurance_agent and property_agent when overlapping issues occur (e.g., property damage or PIP claims).

Use this knowledge to:
- Analyze and classify BI-related claim documents.
- Identify primary and secondary insurance sources.
- Draft informed summaries or responses for case managers or attorneys.
